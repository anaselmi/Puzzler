# PUZZLER

Puzzler is an ASCII based roguelike written in Python using TDL. Primarily intended to be an exercise in organizing and developing a long-term programming project, any actual fun had playing this game is purely accidental.

#### Requirements
+ Python 3.6.3
+ TDL    4.3.1

#### Installation
+ Download requirements and clone repository
+ Run engine.py

#### Features
+ A barely functioning message console
+ A game loop

#### Roadmap
+ Basic UI, Readme
+ Map generation, website
+ Basic combat, design documents
+ Item generation
+ Character creation, combat++
+ Worldbuilding, balancing
+ Map generation++
+ Graphics overhaul
+ Savegames
+ ...

#### Worldbuilding
*The Puzzler, more myth than memory, still eludes all who trace her footsteps.*

*The wars we've waged.*

*The nations we've destroyed.*

*The holies we've profaned.*

*For us, there is no redemption. There are some things even she can't do.*

*Even as the wisest among us say her departure is final, we search. They search.*

*We ruin the books we once read, for now they only lie.*

*We burn the maps we once trusted, for now they only lead us astray.*

*And now we shut our eyes even to the stars themselves.*

*But if the effort was futile, then what do we have?*

*There is nothing we wouldn't do. Nothing we haven't already done.*

*And so we sin.*

*And we all do, for how could we not. This world was not made for the weak.*

*We made it that way.*

*I know she's not coming back. I think we all do.*

*Even the Gods have abandoned hope, even the Gods chase her yet.*

More to come soon

#### Design Documents
Mechanically, the game is still very much in flux. 

Since Puzzler is less about making a game and more about learning how to program,

I forsee a lot of design compromises made in the name of challenge. However, I'm still making a game, 

and that means I want it to be fun. As I implement more and more features, 

I'll begin to have a better idea of what works and what doesn't. But for now, not much is set in stone. 

Other than these principals.

##### Guiding Principals

1. Don't build a complex simulation, build many small systems

2. Let these systems talk, using the shared language of simple data

2. In order to interact with and affect these systems, the player needs options and information

3. These interactions have consequences that affect these systems in meaningful ways

#### FAQ
+ How do I contribute?

      I'll have a better idea when this project picks up steam.

      Light refactoring.
