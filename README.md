### Worldbuilding
*All who tried have failed. The Puzzler, more myth than memory, still eludes all who follow her footsteps.*

*Even the Gods have abandoned hope, even the Gods chase her yet.*

More to come soon

### Design Documents
Mechanically, the game is very much in flux. 

Since Puzzler is less about making a game and more about learning how to program,

I forsee a lot of design compromises made in the name of challenge. However, I'm still making a game, 

and that means I want it to be fun. As I implement more and more features, 

I'll begin to have a better idea of what works and what doesn't. But for now, not much is set in stone. 

Other than these principals.

# Guiding Principals

1. Complex systems arise simple systems

2. Give the player options and information

3. Actions have consequences

### FAQ
+ How do I contribute?

      I'll have a better idea when this project picks up steam.
