# PUZZLER

Puzzler is an ASCII based roguelike written in Python using TDL. Primarily intended to be an exercise in organizing and developing a long-term programming project, any actual fun had playing this game is purely accidental.

+ TDL    4.3.1

#### Installation
+ Download requirements and clone repository
+ Run engine.py

#### Features
+ A barely functioning message console
+ A game loop

#### Roadmap
+ Basic UI, Readme
+ Map generation, website
+ Basic combat, design documents

#### Design Documents
Mechanically, the game is still very much in flux. 

Since Puzzler is less about making a game and more about learning how to program,

I forsee a lot of design compromises made in the name of challenge. However, I'm still making a game, 

and that means I want it to be fun. As I implement more and more features, 

I'll begin to have a better idea of what works and what doesn't. But for now, not much is set in stone. 

Other than these principals.

##### Guiding Principals

1. Don't build a complex simulation, build many small systems

2. Let these systems talk, using the shared language of simple data

2. In order to interact with and affect these systems, the player needs options and information

3. These interactions have consequences that affect these systems in meaningful ways

#### FAQ
+ How do I contribute?

      I'll have a better idea when this project picks up steam.

      Light refactoring.
